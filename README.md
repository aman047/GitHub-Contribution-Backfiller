## 📜 Key Scripts

### `generate_learning_notes.py`
- Automatically generates dummy learning content in `.ipynb`, `.py`, `.html`, `.css`, `.h5`, and `.sql` formats.
- Creates organized folders for topics like Python, Machine Learning, Cloud, SQL, Excel, etc.

### `learning_notes.py`
- Commits the files generated above on randomized days (e.g., 3-4 commits per week).
- Uses `subprocess` to execute Git commands with backdated commit messages.
- Final `git push` updates the GitHub contribution graph.
